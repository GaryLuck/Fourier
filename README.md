# Fourier Transform Demo

An interactive Python program that demonstrates the Fourier Transform using ASCII terminal graphs.

## Features

- Generate three waveform types: sine, square, and sawtooth
- Display time domain waveforms as ASCII art
- Compute and display the frequency domain (FFT magnitude spectrum)
- Interactive menu for selecting waveforms

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the program:

```
python fourier_demo.py
```

Select a waveform from the menu and the program will display both the time domain and frequency domain graphs in your terminal.
